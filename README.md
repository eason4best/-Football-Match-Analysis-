#My final project of the course "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming"

Using Shiny Dashboard of R to create an application analysing certain football match. 
Basically, I created some dummy data including number of pass, number of shot, pass accuracy etc. 
and create a csv file to store them. Then I imported the csv file into R and make them appear on Shiny Dashbard,
also drew a heatmap representing area of certain player covered.
