#My final project of the course "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming"

Using Shiny Dashboard of R to create an application analysing certain football match. 
Basically, I created some dummy data including number of pass, number of shot, pass accuracy etc. ,and put all of them in a csv file. 
Then I imported the file into R and make those data appear on Shiny Dashbard depend on which player user had selected, also drew a heatmap representing area of certain player covered.
